<p><a name="Q01"><i><b><font color="#000080">Q: When I insert the CD in the drive, the installation doesn't start
automatically. What's wrong?</font></b></i></a></p>

<p>R: You probably deactivated the auto-insert notification. To enable this
notification, open the <b>Start</b> menu, select <b>Settings</b>, then <b>Control
Panel</b>, and double-click on the <b>System</b> icon. Double-click on the <b>CDROM</b>
branch on the <b>Device Manager</b> tab, and then double-click the entry for
your CD-ROM drive. On the <b>Settings</b> tab, check the <b>Auto Insert
Notification</b> check box. Click <b>OK</b>, click <b>Close</b>, and then click <b>Yes</b>
when you are prompted to restart your computer.</p>

<p>You can also launch manually the auto-insert application. Open your Windows
Explorer. Double-click on your CD-ROM drive. Click on the <b>AUTORUN</b>
directory, then double-click on the <b>AUTORUN.EXE</b> program.</p>

<hr size="1">

<p><a name="Q02"><i><b><font color="#000080">Q: When I insert the CD, the following error
is displayed: "c:\windows\system32\autoexec.nt. The system file is not suitable for running
MS-DOS and Microsoft applications. Choose 'Close' to terminate the application". The name of
the file may be "autoexec.nt" or "config.nt"</font></b></i></a></p>

<p>R: Please refer to the following article from the Microsoft Support Knowledge base:<br>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;324767" target=_blank>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;324767</a></p>
<p>When you insert the CD in the drive, Windows launches a program called <b>AUTORUN.EXE</b> located in
the <b>AUTORUN</b> folder of the CD. This program is a 16-bits application that lets you choose 
between installing the software and visit our internet web site.</p>
<p>To install eMedia Card Designer, browse the "<b>\eMedia</b>" folder and launch the <b>setup.exe</b>
program located in it.</p>

<hr size="1">

<p><a name="Q03"><i><b><font color="#000080">Q: After installing DCOM for Windows 95 or DCOM for Windows 98, the
computer asks me to reboot the system. When the system restarts, a message box
tells me that SETUP.EXE cannot be found. What must I do?</font></b></i></a></p>

<p>R: The eMedia setup program is probably on a network drive, or on a drive
that is not available at boot time. Click <b>OK</b> to close the box. Let your
system finish the restart, then launch manually the eMedia setup program (see
above). The eMedia setup program will check your system and find that DCOM is
installed. The installation process will then continue.</p>

<hr size="1">

<p><a name="Q04"><i><font color="#000080"><b>Q: I had installed successfully DCOM, then MDAC without restarting the
system. I restarted the system at the very end of the installation process. Now,
eMedia doesn't work and displays error messages when I start it. Is there a bug
in the installation application?</b></font></i></a></p>

<p>R: MDAC must be installed only once DCOM is fully functionnal. If you didn't
reboot between the DCOM and MDAC installations, MDAC is incorrectly installed,
and eMedia encounters problems, due to the unsuccessful installation of MDAC.
Re-launch the eMedia setup program to correct the problem (see above).</p>

<hr size="1">

<p><a name="Q05"><i><b><font color="#000080">Q: I installed sucessfully DCOM but didn't restart the computer. Then, I
restarted the eMedia setup program, and this one tells me that DCOM is not
installed!</font></b></i></a></p>

<p>R: This is normal. DCOM is only fully installed once your computer has been
restarted.</p>

<hr size="1">

<p><a name="Q06"><i><b><font color="#000080">Q: When eMedia setup installs MDAC, my computer hangs.</font></b></i></a></p>

<p>R: Try to use the NumLock key. If the light goes out and in, your computer
isn't halted. The MDAC installation process can take a very long time. Up to ten
minutes. Let MDAC installs itself completely. It can be very time consuming.</p>

<hr size="1">

<p><a name="Q07"><i><b><font color="#000080">Q: I had installed successfully eMedia, but when
I start the software, the following error occurs: &quot;</font>Error nn,
sub-error 2 (EVPB1)<font color="#000080">&quot;.
The eMedia.log file in the eMedia installation folder contains the following
line: &quot;EVPB1 nn : Sub-error #2&quot;. I can't start eMedia anymore.</font></b></i></a></p>

<p>R: This error occurs on certain systems and is due to a partial installation
of MDAC components on eMedia setup. The major cause of this error is a
compatibility problem between MDAC 2.5 provided with eMedia and the MDAC version
currently on the system.</p>

<p>You can resolve this problem by installing <b>MDAC 2.7.0.7713.4</b>, provided
on the distribution CD:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Insert the eMedia installation CD in your drive.</li>
  <li>With your Windows Explorer, browse the &quot;<b>\eMedia\Support</b>&quot;
    folder.</li>
  <li>Double-click on <b>MDAC_TYP_27.EXE</b> file and install it.</li>
</ul>

<hr size="1">

<p><a name="Q08"><i><b><font color="#000080">Q: I can't see the 
online help&nbsp;!</font></b></i></a></p>

<p>The online help uses the new HTML help system from Microsoft 
Corporation. If you can't see it, it can be due to a wrong installation of the 
HTML help system.</p>

<p>You can resolve this by installing the help system upgrade,
<b>Hhupd.exe</b>, provided on the CD:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Insert the eMedia installation CD in your drive.</li>
  <li>With your Windows Explorer, browse the &quot;<b>\eMedia\Support</b>&quot;
    folder.</li>
  <li>Double-click on <b>HHUPD.EXE</b> file and install it.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this doesn't correct your problem, please contact 
the eMedia support team: <a href="mailto:support@emedia-cards.com">support@emedia-cards.com</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Q09"><i><b><font color="#000080">Q: Errors 1931 on hhctrl.ocx or hh.exe</font></b></i></a></p>

<p>This error can be fired by the product installation if these 
files are reserved by the Operating System. Discard these errors and continue 
installation. If you can't see the online help during program execution, please 
refer to the <a href="#Q08">question above</a>.</p>

<hr size="1">

<p><a name="Q00"><i><b><font color="#000080">Q: All the answers above can't apply to me. I still have problems.</font></b></i></a></p>

<p>R: There are three ways to install eMedia manually:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can use the verbose version of Setup.exe to help you to find where the
    problem is located,</li>
  <li>You can install the packages by yourself,</li>
  <li>You can install all the files manually.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>1. Using the verbose version of <font face="Courier New">Setup.exe</font></b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Copy the <font face="Courier New">\eMedia</font> folder and all its subfolders from the
    installation CD into a blank directory of your hard drive.</li>
  <li>Delete the <font face="Courier New">Setup.exe</font> file in your target folder.</li>
  <li>Rename the <font face="Courier New">Setup.dat</font> file and call it <font face="Courier New">Setup.exe</font></li>
  <li>Launch the <font face="Courier New">Setup.exe</font> program. This
    installation program is identical to the one provided, but displays messages
    about what it is doing. If errors occurs, the corresponding messages are
    displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2. Install the packages by yourself</b></p>

<ul>
  <li> DCOM manual installation: you will find in the <font face="Courier New">eMedia\Win9x</font>
    directory of the CD the files <b> DCOM95.EXE</b> and <b>DCOM98.EXE</b>. Launch
    <b> DCOM95.EXE</b> if
    you have a Windows 95™ operating system. Launch <b> DCOM98.EXE</b> if you have a
    Windows 98™, or Windows 98SE™ operating system. Check for the error messages that could
    appear, and then contact the Microsoft support. If the installer ask you to
    reboot at the end of the process, restart your computer. If your computer
    runs Windows ME, Windows NT 4 or Windows 2000 operating systems, do not
    install DCOM.</li>
  <li> MDAC manual installation: you will find in the <font face="Courier New">eMedia\Common</font>
    directory of the CD the file <b>MDAC_TYP.EXE</b>. Launch this program and check for
    the error messages that could appear, and then contact the Microsoft
    support. If the installer ask you to reboot at the end of the process,
    restart your computer.</li>
  <li>Install Microsoft Windows Installer™ manually. You will find in the <font face="Courier New">
  eMedia\Setup</font> folder of the CD the files <b>INSTMSIA.EXE</b>. and<b> 
  INSTMSIW.EXE</b>.<b> </b>Launch <b>INSTMSIA.EXE</b> if your computer runs Windows 95™, Windows 98™,
    Windows 98SE™ or Windows ME™ operating systems, and <b>INSTMSIW.EXE</b>if your computer runs 
    Windows NT4™, Windows 2000™ or Windows XP™ operating systems. Check for the error messages that 
    could appear and contact the Microsoft support.</li>
  <li>If you plan to use DirectShot, install the support files manually. You will find in the 
    <font face="Courier New">eMedia\DirectShot</font> directory of the CD the file 
    <b>DCGenAX.exe</b>. Launch this file and follow the instructions. Check for the error messages 
    that could appear and contact the eMedia support team.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> eMedia manual installation: you will find in the <font face="Courier New">eMedia\Setup</font>
    folder of the CD the file <b>Setup.exe</b>. Double-click on this file to install the software. 
    Check for the error messages that could appear then contact the eMedia support team.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3. Installing the files manually</b></p>
